      As a product designer with nearly <strong>20 years of experience</strong>â€”15 of those as an independent,
      remote-first professional, I've had the opportunity to work with brands like <strong>Lego, Nissan,
        Walgreens,</strong> and <strong>Mattel</strong>, and play key roles in projects such as <strong
        class="text-cream">TestFlight</strong>,
      <strong class="text-cream"> Philharmonic,</strong> and <strong class="text-cream">Disney SpellStruck</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion for design and process go hand-in-hand. When <strong>workflows</strong> are thoughtfully designed to
      <strong>foster creativity</strong>, open communication, and collaboration, you get surprising outcomesâ€”and
      <strong>products people love</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letâ€™s bring your vision to life and create the next success story together.

        <h3>UX for Game Dev</h3>

      <p>As a tech designer, I love to cross-pollinate. I can enhance your game development process by creating
        intuitive,
        engaging player experiences. I'll design user-friendly interfaces, streamline gameplay mechanics, and craft
        compelling user journeys. My expertise in scalable design systems enables rapid prototyping and faster
        implementation. I also prioritize usability and accessibility, ensuring your game appeals to a broad audience.
        Through user testing and iterative design, I'll help resolve issues early, optimizing player satisfaction
        while
        saving time and resources.</p>
