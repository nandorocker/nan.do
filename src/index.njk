      As a product designer with nearly <strong>20 years of experience</strong>â€”15 of those as an independent,
      remote-first professional, I've had the opportunity to work with brands like <strong>Lego, Nissan,
        Walgreens,</strong> and <strong>Mattel</strong>, and play key roles in projects such as <strong
        class=" text-cream">TestFlight</strong>,
      <strong class="text-cream"> Philharmonic,</strong> and <strong class="text-cream">Disney SpellStruck</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion for design and process go hand-in-hand. When <strong>workflows</strong> are thoughtfully designed to
      <strong>foster creativity</strong>, open communication, and collaboration, you get surprising outcomesâ€”and
      <strong>products people love</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letâ€™s bring your vision to life and create the next success story together.
