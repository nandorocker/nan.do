    <h3>A Tale of Epic Collaborations</h3>
    <p>Disney Spellstruck was a project by Artist Arcade in collaboration with David Bettner, the creator of Words with
        Friends. In collaboration with the most beloved crew of Disney characters and Apple Arcade's commitment to
        create
        safe, accessible, and engaging experiences for players of all ages, I focus on seamless UX/UI that embraces the
        best
        practices of accessibility, amplifies immersion, and allows intuitive gameplay. This game was a collaborative
        effort
        from a small team that was spread out across the globe and required meticulous planning and creative
        problem-solving.</p>

    <h3>W-O-N-D-E-R</h3>
    <p>Putting a twist on a classic is easy, creating a game that's fun, clever and unexpected is another. Doing all of
        that, plus using beloved characters and bringing a Disney-worthy experience... well, that presented some
        challenges:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multi-Platform Support:</strong> Ensuring seamless gameplay across phones, tablets and TVs—through
            touch, keyboard + mouse, and gamepads.</li>
        <li><strong>The Disney Experience:</strong> Creating a magical, engaging experience that honored Disney’s iconic
            characters.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple Arcade’s Rules of Play:</strong> Adhering to family-friendly guidelines, with no in-app
            purchases,
            and delivering a polished, cohesive game experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Localization for a Global Audience:</strong> Ensuring the game’s word puzzles and UI were accurately
            translated into multiple languages while maintaining cultural relevance.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterative Content Design:</strong> Building systems that allowed frequent additions of Disney
            characters
            and features without disrupting existing gameplay mechanics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Approach</h3>
    <h4>The Meaning of "UI/UX"</h4>
    <p>In games, the term UI/UX often means "Visual Design." To me, it's part UI designer, part game designer and part
        psychologist: I'm here to serve the game experience created by the team, as well as the player, through my
        knowledge
        of usability and psychology.</p>
    <p>In SpellStruck, that comprised of several aspects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Flows:</strong> understanding the rhythm of the game, as well as the order of screens, messages
            were crucial to encourage gameplay, make things intuitive and keep players coming back</li>
        <li><strong>Screens and overlays:</strong> the layout of areas such as the home screen, as well as in-game
            overlays,
            sidebars, popups and messaging</li>
        <li><strong>Controls:</strong> developing a control system that scaled to all Apple Arcade supported devices
        </li>
        <li><strong>Gameplay elements:</strong> the core elements used to play the game, as well as the messaging
            (verbal
            &amp; non-verbal) provided by those elements, for example, whether a move is allowed or not, correct or not,
            or
            the impact of events like power-ups.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Iterative Prototyping</h4>
    <p>We tested frequently across devices. Rapid feedback cycles (both internal AND external) allowed us to hone
        interactions and address player needs before finalizing features.</p>
    <h4>Teamwork and Trust</h4>
    <p>Collaboration was at the heart of this project. Our team worked closely with Disney to ensure their iconic
        characters
        were faithfully represented. I worked closely with both artists and engineers to provide solutions that were fun
        and
        easy to implement.</p>
    <h4>Usability and Accessibility</h4>
    <p>We followed the Apple Human Interface guidelines closely, prioritizing usability and accessibility in every
        control and information design decision.</p>

<section class="contain-narrow margins-x-wide">
    <h3>Crafting the Magic</h3>
    <p>Regardless of project, I always start with some standard practices: wireframing the player journey, and
        developing a
        simple and modular design system. The process is validate, test, iterate: start with well-known patterns,
        validate
        and then ask yourself: is this fun?</p>
    <h4>The Tiles</h4>
    <p>The tile system is the core part of the gameplay. In normal Scrabble, all tiles look about the same, differing
        only
        by punctuation (double letter, triple word, etc). In our game, aside from those things, we had power-ups and on
        top
        of that, tiles were all individually designed to represent the characters. Things got messy pretty quick, so it
        was
        my responsibility to come up with a system. After much iteration, the result was a combination of colors,
        outlines
        as well as VFX.</p>
    <p>But visuals were only one layer. While controlling the touch version was simple, gamepad was a concern. Nobody
        likes
        to type on a gamepad, fishing for letters one by one—yet this game is basically that. We needed to try things.
        Through very focused work sessions with Ferran, we used simple graphics and prototypes to answer the question:
        which
        controls are fastest and flow best? </p>
    <p>Some of our challenges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How to easily switch between board and tile rack?</li>
        <li>How to clearly visualize the cursor, among with all the other tile states?</li>
        <li>How to quickly manipulate letters in the rack (or shuffle them)</li>
        <li>How to correct mistakes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these problems was addressed in a "barebones" way, not too concerned about creative direction at first
        and
        thoroughly tested. Some of what we tried:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Establish one button as "back", another "action"</li>
        <li>Use a color system exclusive to cursors, outside the art direction (akin to TV outlines)</li>
        <li>Create a "picked up" state for tiles that make them exaggeratedly big</li>
        <li>Cancel words with a simple button click</li>
        <li>and many others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of these immediately worked. Others took iterations, but we ultimately found the best combination that is in
        the
        game today.</p>
    <h4>The World Map</h4>
    <p>Another challenge was the game map. Initially, we focused on making sure players could intuitively see their
        progress, access different levels, and understand what lay ahead. The initial challenges were not simple:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does the player understand the relationship between maps (i.e., the "world")</li>
        <li>Does the player know how many levels there are in this map?</li>
        <li>Can the player understand their progress?</li>
        <li>Can the player navigate without difficulty, on all input devices?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From the start, we used rich graphics, but the interactive parts (paths, levels points, states) as well as
        transitions took many tries. There were many discussions and iterations about the <strong>active state</strong>,
        confirmation popups, transition between maps and what our two buttons did, as well as the touch/mouse
        equivalents.
    </p>
    <p>Considering the limitations, we have a robust and fairly usable implementation, where the core interactions are
        straightforward.</p>

    <h3>What I Learned From SpellStruck</h3>
    <p>Disney Spellstruck took UX to the fore in crafting compelling player experiences. From intuitive controls down to
        seamless user flows, UX connected creative vision with practical implementation and made the game both
        delightful
        and accessible.</p>
    <p>Equally important was interdiscipline collaboration. Tight collaboration with game designers, artists, and
        engineers
        provided an innovative and cohesive solution, be it refining the tile mechanics or preserving the charm of
        Disney.
        The project was a testament to the fact that considerate design and good collaboration across disciplines can
        turn a
        challenge into an enduring and impactful experience. This is a principle I carry out in every project.</p>
