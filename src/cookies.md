### How We Use Cookies

We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most cases there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.

### Disabling Cookies

You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and features of this site. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.
The nan.do Cookie Consent tool can be utilized to customize your cookie preferences. The tool will record when you have consented to our cookie policy and will ask for consent periodically to ensure users stay up-to-date with changes to our cookie and privacy policies. The consent tool specifically controls the marketing cookies and analytical cookies set by using the nan.do website. Essential cookies cannot be disabled.

### The Cookies We Set

If you create an account with us, then we will use cookies for the management of the signup process and general administration. These cookies will usually be deleted when you log out; however, in some cases they may remain afterwards to remember your site preferences when logged out.

### Login related cookies

We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember that you are logged in. This prevents you from having to log in every single time you visit a new page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and areas when logged in.
### Email newsletters related cookies

This site offers newsletter or email subscription services and cookies may be used to remember if you are already registered and whether to show certain notifications which might only be valid to subscribed/unsubscribed users.
### Forms related cookies

When you submit data to us through a form such as those found on contact pages or comment forms, cookies may be set to remember your user details for future correspondence.
### Essential cookies

### Analytics

Analytics allow us to count visits and traffic sources to the website, so that we can measure and improve the performance of our site. Analytics let us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All of the information collected from analytics cookies is aggregated so it is anonymous.
Marketing

We use only a few third party cookies. We use Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google's pixels to track our marketing efforts.
